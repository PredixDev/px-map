A lightweight framework for building interactive maps using Polymer web components.
The framework includes `px-map`, a base mapping component that can be extended by
and controls a variety of sub-components that display geospatial data, offer
controls for the user, and accomplish other common mapping tasks.

This is a simple example with little configuration that will display a map
centered on Tokyo, Japan:

    <px-map lat="35.6895" lon="139.6917" zoom="12">
    </px-map>

Maps can be extended with a variety of attributes and by passing sub-components
into the tag. We can extend the map above by changing how the map initially draws
in its container, and by placing an overlay layer with markers showing interesting
landmarks in Tokyo:

    <px-map lat="35.6895" lon="139.6917" zoom="15" flex-to-size fit-to-markers>
      <px-map-overlay-layer name="Landmarks">
        <px-map-static-icon lat="35.6763976" lon="35.6763976">
          <slot name="title">Meiji Jingu</slot>
        </px-map-static-icon>
        <px-map-static-icon lat="35.6654861" lon="139.7706668">
          <slot name="title">Tsukiji Market</slot>
        </px-map-static-icon>
      </px-map-overlay-layer>
    </px-map>

See the component's API documentation pages for more information on possible
configurations and available sub-components.

### What's provided

The following pieces are provided by `px-map` and its sub-components:

* Base map: Orchestrates tile layers, overlay layers, and interactive controls
* Tile layers: Display mapping tiles showing geography or other information
* Overlay layers: Display interactive geospatial data on top of the map tiles
* UI components: Display markers, circles, polygons, and other repsentations of data on the map
* Controls: Offer a variety of user controls to manipualte the map and explore its data

### Underlying map library

The current iteration of `px-map` uses the open source Leaflet library as a base
for display a map with base tiles and geospatial overlays. Future iterations of
the component may offer the ability to use a different library in place of
Leaflet, while keeping the same basic API.
